# BiomedScrape_textmining_misctools
Series of supplementary open-source tools for text-mining generally developed as adjuncts to functionalities from popular modules such as gensim and scikit-learn, such as document comparison/cosine similarity using word bigrams instead of bag-of-words and selective scraping of specified portions of tokenized text from a corpus (e.g. the "middle-third technique" to remove both the most and least common tokenized terms to examine a "usually buried but significant and informative" proportion of the tokens between two or more documents being compared by cosine similarity.
